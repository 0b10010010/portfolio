My name is Alex and I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University. When I am not teaching Controls lab sections, I spend my time developing for our student organization called SUAS (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems) Design Team. Working with my teammates, I led the development of image analysis system to capture and localize targets in ROI (Region of Interest) from the ground up. I also had an opportunity to lead the team as a president as well as serving as a treasurer. I enjoyed my time as an intern integrating a flight controls system from theory into implementation at 4D Avionic Systems. I had an amazing experience bringing company's vision into the beginning of reality by prototyping, analyzing, and creating/modifying software.
