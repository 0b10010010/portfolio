My name is Donghyun and I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University. When I am not teaching Controls lab sections or doing research for my thesis, I spend my time developing for our student organization called SUAS (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems) Design Team. Working with my teammates, I led the development of image analysis system to capture and localize targets in ROI (Region of Interest) from the ground up. I also had an opportunity to lead the team as a president as well as serving as a treasurer. During the summer of 2020 I had an exciting opportunity to join an internship program at 4D Avionic Systems. I enjoyed the challenges of my work integrating a flight controls system from theory into a testable prototype. I had an amazing experience bringing company's vision into the beginning of reality by prototyping, analyzing, and creating/modifying software to ensure the safety and performance of test flights. During my internship with the company, I learned valuable lessons working with open source platforms and I loved every moment tinkering with the prototype. Finding something I love spending time with is important to me. Whether if it is work or hobby, I prefer to immerse myself into and being able to share that moment with passionate teams to bring something meaningful together sounds like a solid foundation towards better outcomes as a whole.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#donghyun-kims-engineering-portfolio","text":"Hello and thank you for stopping by!

The company has been working on simulating a new flight navigation algorithm and needed someone to develop a working prototype to test and showcase. The prototype I delivered at the end of my internship was capable of flying the new flight navigation algorithm. Also, to adhere to FAA regulations on unmanned aircrafts, learning about various regulations and limits while out test flying was beneficial. From the moment I walked into the office, my mind was all about figuring out the structure and components of the system. From selecting batteries to frame size and firmware on the autopilot, it was like Christmas. Of course I had few headaches along the way dealing with Linux driver issues and dependency problems but in the end I was very satisfied with the result.","title":"4D Avionic Systems"},{"location":"projects/4davsys/#4d-avionic-systems","text":"During the summer of 2020, I was fortunate enough to apply what I have learned so far from SUAS Design Team as an intern at 4D Avionic Systems.

The process is based on HITL (Human In The Loop). The operator can check incoming images for targets which are colored alphanumeric characters printed on some shapes. Then the operator can scroll in and out to inspect the image and drag to crop the target along with its metadata to export out for submission. The GUI will return calculated GPS coordinates of each targets within the image. The system is based on an OBC (Onboard Computer), STM32L4 Nucleo, camera, and GPS receiver. When the voltage of hotshoe on camera goes low, or high depending on the camera, triggers an interrupt routine on a microcontroller to send the last known filtered GPS location as serial data over USB. Then the OBC will convert serial data into a text file with new GPS coordinates on camera trigger appended. The directory where images and GPS data are stored is mirrored with another directory on GCS (Ground Control Station). The following is an example output: Image index: 1 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:32:200239166 lat/lon: 39.2027969,-96.5458908 Image index: 2 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:35:400238232 lat/lon: 39.2027969,-96.5442504 Image index: 3 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:38:200237413 lat/lon: 39.2027931,-96.5458908 Image index: 4 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:41:400236475 lat/lon: 39.2027931,-96.5458908","title":"SUAS Design Team"},{"location":"projects/suas/#suas-design-team","text":"","title":"SUAS Design Team"},{"location":"projects/suas/#image-analysis","text":"The following screenshot shows the user interface I developed in order to load, crop, classify, geolocate, and export target images taken during the flight.
