My name is Donghyun and I am a former research engineer at 4D Avionic Systems. More specifically, my day to day responsibility with the company was implementation of algorithm and testing avionic software and hardware. For my education, I was a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University. When I was not teaching Controls lab sections or doing research for my thesis , I spent my time developing for our student organization named SUAS (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems) Design Team. Working with my teammates, I led the development of image analysis system from the ground up. The purpose was to capture, localize, and identify characteristics of targets in ROI (Region of Interest). I also had an opportunity to lead the team as a president as well as a treasurer responsible with allocating funds. During the summer of 2020 I had an exciting opportunity to join an internship program at 4D Avionic Systems. I enjoyed the challenges of my work integrating a theoretical flight controls system into a testable prototype. I had an amazing experience bringing the company's vision into a beginning of reality. It was done by prototyping, analyzing, and creating/modifying software to ensure the safety and performance of test flights. During my internship with the company, I learned valuable lessons working with open source platforms while adhering to strict FAA regulations. I truly enjoyed every moment tinkering with the prototype. After successfully completing my two internships with the company, I was offered a full time position following the graduation. Finding something I love spending time with is one of my core value. Whether if it is work or hobby, I like to immerse myself completely. And being able to share that moment with passionate teammates/friends to bring something meaningful together sounds like a solid foundation for success.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#donghyun-kims-engineering-portfolio","text":"Hello and thank you for stopping by!

The company has been working on simulating a new flight navigation algorithm and needed someone to develop a working prototype to test and showcase. The prototype I delivered at the end of my internship was capable of flying the new flight navigation algorithm. Also, to adhere to FAA regulations on unmanned aircrafts, I obtained FAA's part 107 remote pilot license with the company's support. Learning about various regulations and limits with small UAS operation was beneficial. From the moment I walked into the office, my mind was all about figuring out the structure and components of the system. From selecting batteries to frame size and firmware on the autopilot, it was like Christmas. Of course I had few headaches along the way dealing with Linux driver issues and dependency problems but in the end I was very satisfied with the result.","title":"4D Avionic Systems"},{"location":"projects/4davsys/#4d-avionic-systems","text":"During the summer of 2020, I was fortunate enough to apply what I have learned so far from SUAS Design Team as an intern at 4D Avionic Systems.

The purpose is to load, crop, classify, geolocate, and export target images taken during the flight. The process is based on HITL (Human In The Loop). The operator can check incoming images for targets which are colored alphanumeric characters printed on some shapes. The operator then can scroll in and out to inspect the image and drag to crop the target image. Along with cropped image, its metadata is exported out for submission. The GUI will also return calculated GPS coordinates of each targets within the image. The system is based on an OBC (Onboard Computer), STM32L4 Nucleo board, Sony camera, and GPS receiver. When the voltage of hotshoe on camera goes low, or high depending on the camera, triggers an interrupt service routine on the microcontroller. The ISR sends the last known filtered GPS location as serial data over USB to the OBC. Then the OBC will convert and append serial data into a text file with new GPS coordinates. The directory that contains cropped images and their GPS coordinates is mirrored with a directory on GCS (Ground Control Station) for submission purposes. The following is an example output: Image index: 1 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:32:200239166 lat/lon: 39.2027969,-96.5458908 Image index: 2 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:35:400238232 lat/lon: 39.2027969,-96.5442504 Image index: 3 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:38:200237413 lat/lon: 39.2027931,-96.5458908 Image index: 4 Date:2020/2/1 18:16:41:400236475 lat/lon: 39.2027931,-96.5458908","title":"SUAS Design Team"},{"location":"projects/suas/#suas-design-team","text":"","title":"SUAS Design Team"},{"location":"projects/suas/#image-analysis","text":"The following screenshot shows the graphical user interface I developed.
