My name is Alex and I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University. When I am not teaching Controls lab sections, I spend my time developing for our student organization called SUAS (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems) Design Team. Working with my teammates, I led the development of image analysis system to capture and localize targets in ROI (Region of Interest) from the ground up. I also had an opportunity to lead the team as a president as well as serving as a treasurer. I enjoyed my time as an intern integrating a flight controls system from theory into implementation at 4D Avionic Systems. I had an amazing experience bringing company's vision into the beginning of reality by prototyping, analyzing, and creating/modifying software. Embedded systems.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#alex-kims-engineering-portfolio","text":"Hello and thank you for stopping by!

The process is based on HITL (Human In The Loop). The operator can check incoming images for targets which are colored alphanumeric characters printed on some shapes. Then the operator can scroll in and out to inspect the image and drag to crop the target along with its metadata to export out for submission. The GUI will return calculated GPS coordinates of each targets within the image.","title":"SUAS Design Team"},{"location":"projects/suas/#suas-design-team","text":"","title":"SUAS Design Team"},{"location":"projects/suas/#image-analysis","text":"The following screenshot shows the user interface I developed in order to load, crop, classify, geolocate, and export target images taken during the flight.
