##Image Analysis

The following screenshot shows the user interface I developed in order to load, crop, classify, geolocate, and export target images taken during the flight. The process is based on HITL (Human In The Loop).

The operator can check incoming images for targets which are colored alphanumeric characters printed on some shapes. Then the operator can scroll in and out to inspect the image and drag to crop the target along with its metadata to export out for submission. The GUI will return calculated GPS coordinates of each targets within the image.
