# Donghyun Kim's Engineering Portfolio

Hello and thank you for stopping by! My name is Donghyun and I am a former research engineer at 4D Avionic Systems. More specifically, my day to day responsibility with the company was implementation of algorithm and testing avionic software and hardware.

For my education, I was a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University. When I was not teaching [Controls](https://catalog.k-state.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=82554) lab sections or doing research for my [thesis](https://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/41887), I spent my time developing for our student organization named SUAS (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems) Design Team. Working with my teammates, I led the development of [image analysis](https://github.com/0b10010010/ImageAnalysis) system from the ground up. The purpose was to capture, localize, and identify characteristics of targets in ROI (Region of Interest). I also had an opportunity to lead the team as a president as well as a treasurer responsible with allocating funds.

During the summer of 2020 I had an exciting opportunity to join an internship program at 4D Avionic Systems. I enjoyed the challenges of my work integrating a theoretical flight controls system into a testable prototype. I had an amazing experience bringing the company's vision into a beginning of reality. It was done by prototyping, analyzing, and creating/modifying software to ensure the safety and performance of test flights. During my internship with the company, I learned valuable lessons working with open source platforms while adhering to strict FAA regulations. I truly enjoyed every moment tinkering with the prototype. After successfully completing my two internships with the company, I was offered a full time position following the graduation.

Finding something I love spending time with is one of my core value. Whether if it is work or hobby, I like to immerse myself completely. And being able to share that moment with passionate teammates/friends to bring something meaningful together sounds like a solid foundation for success.
