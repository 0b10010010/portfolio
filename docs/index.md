# Alex Kim's Engineering Portfolio

Hello, thank you for stopping by! My name is Alex and I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University. My focus is in automatic controls with embedded systems. I have developed my interest in this field by joining a student competition organization, SUAS Design Team (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems).
I have led the team as a president for a year when I was elected to the leadership position, as well as serving the team as a team leader of Image Analysis subteam and as a treasurer.
With the background in controls, I have been teaching [Controls](https://catalog.k-state.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=82554) lab sections for undergraduate students here at Kansas State.
